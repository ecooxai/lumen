# Lumen: handoff notes

## Current goal (user, 2026-10-08)
Lower RAM/CPU/GPU/load time than Chrome on: YouTube home, 2 YouTube videos playing,
bing.com, Google search with AI Overview — all loaded and active. Compare with
off-screen media eviction setting off and on (on: target < 150 MB for YouTube playing).

## Done
- RAM: decoder threads capped (4), CSS custom props share parent chain, script sources
  freed, VQ_MAX 3, selector vectors trimmed. Single YouTube ~300 MB (was 396).
- VideoToolbox hardware decode (`LUMEN_HWDEC=0` disables), software fallback.
- Real tabs in one process (`src/app/main.c`: `Tab`, `tab_new/select/open/close`,
  tab strip in chrome, Cmd+T/W/1-9, Ctrl+Tab; extra argv URLs open as tabs).
  Background tabs keep JS ticking and media playing.

## Next
- Off-screen media eviction setting (default off).
- CPU: profile shows swscale NV12->BGRA + memmove; consider GPU NV12 upload.
- Rerun 5-page compare: `~/sites/lumen-tabs.sh`, `~/sites/chrome-tabs.mjs`, `~/sites/cpusum.sh`.

## Chrome 154 baseline (5 tabs)
RAM 1,307-1,314 MB, peak sum ~1,850 MB, CPU 10-14%, GPU proc ~94 MB, video 854x480.
Load (DCL/load): Google 0.53/3.66 s, Bing 1.97/2.23 s, YT watch ~2.2/3.47 s, YT home 2.29/2.33 s.
