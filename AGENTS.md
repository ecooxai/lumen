# Agent notes for Lumen

See `CONTINUE.md` for project state, build layout and next steps.

## Host compilation CPU budget

All new project compilation may share 60% of all host logical CPUs, per the
user's latest instruction (480% total on this eight-core host). This is a
shared budget, not 480% per task. Keep at most six compiler jobs per build;
use fewer for memory-heavy work. The old V8 source build remains safety-frozen;
do not resume or restart it while adopting the verified prebuilt.
Launch those commands through `python3 tools/codex_compile.py COMMAND ARGS...`.
The wrapper uses the shared systemd user slice
`codex-lumen-compile.slice` with `CPUQuota=480%` and a 100 ms period, and fails
closed if quota setup fails. The compatibility `--v8` option uses the same
shared slice. All builds inherit SCHED_IDLE and nice 19. Use Gradle
`--no-daemon` and do not reuse compiler daemons launched
outside the slice. Do not change unrelated host workloads. This is a host build limit,
not an Android browser runtime performance result.

Avoid unnecessary shell wrappers inside the capped scope. This host's ananicy
bash rule assigns nice -4, and two packaging checks stopped on that niceness
violation. Invoke Python/Java tools directly. For SDK apksigner verification,
use the same SDK's `lib/apksigner.jar` through `java -Xmx1024M -jar`, preserving
all verification arguments, instead of its shell launcher. Do not change global
host rules or weaken priority checks to work around this.

## CPU monitoring during every test

Whenever you run Lumen for a test (GUI, ChatGPT, scrolling, typing, video,
benchmarks), sample its CPU every second for the whole run and check it:

```sh
P=$(pgrep -n lumen)
while kill -0 $P 2>/dev/null; do ps -o %cpu=,rss= -p $P; sleep 1; done
```

- Idle pages (nothing animating, no input) should sit near 0-3% CPU.
- Ordinary interaction (typing, scrolling, hover, clicking) should stay
  low; typing in the ChatGPT composer must stay under 10%.
- Sustained high CPU is only acceptable while doing real heavy work (page
  load, video decode, a long streamed reply). Anything else is a bug:
  profile it (`sample <pid> 5 -file out.txt` on macOS, `perf` on Linux),
  find the hot path and fix it before moving on.
- Report the measured CPU numbers with the test results.
