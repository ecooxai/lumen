# Agent notes for Lumen

See `CONTINUE.md` for project state, build layout and next steps.

## CPU monitoring during every test

Whenever you run Lumen for a test (GUI, ChatGPT, scrolling, typing, video,
benchmarks), sample its CPU every second for the whole run and check it:

```sh
P=$(pgrep -n lumen)
while kill -0 $P 2>/dev/null; do ps -o %cpu=,rss= -p $P; sleep 1; done
```

- Idle pages (nothing animating, no input) should sit near 0-3% CPU.
- Ordinary interaction (typing, scrolling, hover, clicking) should stay
  low; typing in the ChatGPT composer must stay under 10%.
- Sustained high CPU is only acceptable while doing real heavy work (page
  load, video decode, a long streamed reply). Anything else is a bug:
  profile it (`sample <pid> 5 -file out.txt` on macOS, `perf` on Linux),
  find the hot path and fix it before moving on.
- Report the measured CPU numbers with the test results.
