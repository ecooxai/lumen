# Lume Apple browser: current task 20261029-cpu30

Read `agent/task.md`, `agent/continue.md`, this file, and `CONTINUE.md` before work.
Canonical repository is `/Users/devin/repos/lumen` (requested `~/project/lumen`).
Branch `gpt6-astra-pro_builtin-agents_lume-apple-wpt-20261029-cpu30`. Base source `1fcde424dcaa7ac842623478196d50abfa436760`; inherited dirty cache source is preserved in `f8d3e7380e3e3194c3f34b5cd066113c45dfa1a9`.
Start 2026-10-29T02:18:45+00:00; normal deadline 2026-10-29T05:18:45+00:00; only important bug fixes may extend to 2026-10-29T06:18:45+00:00.
The goal is98/100, maximum1000iterations, bounded by the authorized time. Successful tests, packages or commits are checkpoints.

## Ownership and execution

- Root coordinates and reviews. Three built-in subagents inherit the same model and reasoning: `integration`, `compatibility`, and `performance_release`.
- Child devinmac3d MCP calls have a confirmed hanging defect. Root must transport agent-authored remote commands and scripts; agents perform analysis, implementation and validation. Do not repeat opaque child calls. Prefer canonical workspace over tilde aliases.
- Only `integration` stages, commits or changes branches. Preserve unrelated untracked files and all prior candidate evidence. Do not publish `output/` or `out/` wholesale.
- `compatibility` owns standards/engine regression work. `performance_release` owns src/app/chrome_paint.h, src/app/main.c, tests/test_render_overdraw.c, performance/Apple packaging and progress publication. Coordinate shared native files before touching them.
- Serialize heavy builds, browser test runs and controlled performance measurements. Use existing build caches and architecture/platform-compatible prebuilt V8.
- Monitor process CPU/RSS every second for every build/test. Record gaps, workload, PID identity, binary SHA-256, wall time, peaks, p95 and task-owned cleanup. Investigate stages exceeding five minutes. Do not kill unrelated processes or delete active caches.
- User now accepts ordinary scrolling below30%CPU. Idle still targets0–3%; ChatGPT typing remains below10%. Report measured CPU values and memory trends; the new scrolling ceiling does not authorize unchecked performance claims for a changed executable.

## Evidence and publication

- Keep all1515 frozen priority variants visible. WPT case pass rate and subtest pass rate are different. Focused/native custom regressions are not full official WPT results. Full-suite compatibility remains unknown.
- Compare identical upstream cases and revisions, explicit browser binaries and contexts. Preserve errors, timeouts, unsupported and unrun rows. Do not discard real Chrome failures or replace them with assumed100%.
- The qualified official signed Chrome reference is documented in `agent/evidence/102900614-006-chrome-reference.json`. Earlier quarantined reference results remain historical; use the qualified artifact and record its own native failures.
- Same IPA requires the identical signed iOS device package actually executing on each claimed platform. A native Mac build, simulator app, SDK probe or package alone is insufficient. Do not bypass signing/trust checks.
- Use reviewed tracked-source release allowlists. Exclude credentials, private message/tunnel capability fragments, profiles, `.git/config`, unrelated files and dependencies. Keep Git history in a verified bundle/archive when distributing source.
- Commit meaningful progress and save/publish at least every ten completed iterations. Keep exact raw and reviewed evidence distinct; refresh public provenance after each accepted checkpoint.
- `agent/devsummary.md` records each iteration, UTC/user Asia/Shanghai time, score basis and test/build duration. Parallel wall times must not be summed as elapsed session time; model compute duration is unavailable and must not be invented.

## Current continuation 20261029-cpu30-002

Task branch `gpt6-astra-pro_builtin-agents_lume-apple-wpt-20261029-cpu30`. Accepted native remains f52 (`f52a08ca9a1bc6cd79eb082d8bedd7b5851e23341ee7427ff01cddfb038a8a9c`), frozen native source df4ae3bc8d52a06778e0d8a1f706138201dd043d, score **50/100**. Its fresh selected WPT is **96/103 (93.204%)**, with **1412/1515 frozen variants unrun**; original six files pass **1850/1850 assertions**. Its controlled scrolling p95 **11.085%**, peak **11.137%**, 34 samples over33.010s meets the30%limit;20-navigation settled RSS157.344→146.562MiB, idle p95~1%. Do not transfer those resource results to another executable.

Current JSON/BOM candidate `4b26d5b59edf9f6866b1317e6ffa29aabe7d8681cdee26a2b56a670d23536d54` has **98/103 fully passing variants (95.146%)**,23629PASS/29FAIL assertions and the same1412unrun. Original six files still pass1850/1850 separately. Exact source base `c7f6ad5651f66cd9fed9c2ce1ec53acb33f51713` and manifest `agent/evidence/20261029-cpu30-002/compiled-source-sha256.json` bind its immutable build. JSON MIME documents now default to UTF8 and render literal text; Unicode parsing preserves a second BOM while byte decoding consumes exactly one. Genuine unchanged regressions: JSON2/16→16/16, BOM11/21→21/21. Additional frame15/XHR42/meta29/document78/parser48 checks pass. The initial JSON RED1 failed its parent precondition and remains explicitly invalid evidence; its later pass only checks the driver repair. This candidate still needs its own GUI/resource gate before acceptance.

Private message continuity keeps explicit messageSessionId102900614 across task20261029-cpu30, preserving ordinary reload access and client receipts. New two-case regression0/2RED→2/2GREEN plus six existing protocol/security/telemetry cases gives8/8GREEN. The reviewed server switch has rollback and exact old-process guards. Public current task handoff/Surge/source-byte verification is still pending, and release points remain0. Status distinguishes current accepted artifact, functional candidate and historical runs; never pool denominators.

Qualified Chrome ran the identical103 variants:89fully passing,23477PASS/181FAIL,all103harnessesOK. The unexpected differences are under investigation; preserve raw outcomes and do not infer an overall browser ranking. Decoder fatal recovery remains under controlled investigation. Two worker-XHR variants still have26failures and are not repaired by a global shim. Full official WPT remains unknown.

Apple: nativeMac verified; iPad simulator OS reachable but no Lume app execution proof; no signing identity, signed deviceIPA or compatible iOS V8 archive. Xcode bundle exists but SDK resolution fails. Shared deviceIPA-on-Mac and iPad app points remain unearned; no extra iPhone execution gate applies. Existing prebuilt HomebrewV8 15.6.75.16arm64 is reused.

Next: push/package this source checkpoint, compose fresh status, verify the guarded live/Surge handoff and public source archive, then complete controlled decoder work and exact-candidate WPT/GUI checks. Only integration stages/commits. Immutable older output is retained; profiles, access keys and runtime output remain ignored. Root brokers Mac tool calls, with three same-model built-in agents. Task start02:18:45UTC; normal deadline05:18:45UTC, critical-fix-only maximum06:18:45UTC. Scope and all raw evidence: `agent/evidence/20261029-cpu30-002-functional-checkpoint.json`.
